== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need help installing, configuring, or customizing the plugin. =
Please visit [our support site at http://www.paidmembershipspro.com](http://www.paidmembershipspro.com) for more documentation and our support forums.

= I found a bug in the plugin. =
Please post it in the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/paid-memberships-pro?forum_id=10) and we'll fix it right away. Thanks for helping.

= My site is broken or blank or not letting me log in after activating Paid Memberships Pro =
This is typically caused by a conflict with another plugin that is trying to redirect around the login/register pages or trying to redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, etc.

To regain access to your site, FTP to your site and rename the wp-content/plugins/paid-memberships-pro folder to wp-content/plugins/paid-memberships-pro-d (or anything different). Now WP will not be able to find PMPro, and you can gain access to /wp-admin/ again. From there, visit the plugins page to fully deactivate Paid Memberships Pro. (You'll want to rename the folder back to paid-memberships-pro again.)

Long term, you will need to find and fix the conflict. We can usually do this for you very quickly if you sign up for support at https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/pricing/ and send us your WP admin and FTP credentials.

= Does PMPro Support Multisite/Network Installs? =
"Supporting multisite" means different things to different people. [This guide covers the three primary ways](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/network-multisite-mega-post-paid-memberships-pro/) you can use Paid Memberships Pro in a network.

Out of the box PMPro will basically act as a stand alone plugin for each site. Each site has its own list of membership levels, members, payment settings, etc.

Our [Member Network Sites Add On](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/pmpro-network-multisite-membership/) allows members to choose a site name and title at checkout and will set up a network site at checkout.

Our [Multisite Membership Add On](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/pmpro-network-membership/) allows you to manage memberships at the 'Main' Network site and provide or restrict access on other Network Subsites.

If you would like more help using PMPro on a network install, sign up for support at https://www.paidmembershipspro.com.

= Does PMPro Support X? =
Not sure? You can find out by doing a bit a research.

1. [Check our compatibility page](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/documentation/compatibility/).
2. [Check our Add Ons](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/).
3. [Do a search on our site](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/).
4. [Ask in the forums here](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/paid-memberships-pro/).

== Changelog ==
= 2.4.4 - 2020-09-02 =
* BUG FIX: Fixed fatal error that sometimes occurred on the payment settings page when using PHP 5.6 or earlier.
* BUG FIX: Fixed fatal errors that showed up on the frontend invoice page.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where the confirmation message was not showing up in the confirmation email if that option was checked.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_stripe_charge_params filter that can be used to edit or add params sent to the Stripe create charge method. (Thanks, Michael Bester)
* ENHANCEMENT: Tweaked the markup of the invoice page so the payment type information looks a little better.

= 2.4.3 - 2020-08-25
* SECURITY: Fixed a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the code that updates the Required Membership settings on a post. This vulnerability could have been used in conjunction with other security vulnerabilities to trick an admin into editing the membership settings for a page, potentially exposing members only content to non-members. It is unlikely that there was any active exploitation of this vulnerability. This issue may also have shown up as a bug on some sites using page builders, where the membership settings for a post would be cleared out when editing a post. (Thanks to the wp.org plugin review team for catching this issue.)
* SECURITY: Better escaping of variables shown in the Require Membership meta box and related SQL queries.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Renamed the Vietnamese language files to match what is expected.

= 2.4.2 - 2020-08-24
* SECURITY: Updated the PMPro REST API endpoints accessed via the GET method to also require appropriate capabilities to access. The membership confirmation text will be hidden from non-members and non-admins. The endpoints to check a user's level or access to a post require the pmpro_edit_memberships capability now. You should make sure your API users have the appropriate capabilities to use the API. You can use the pmpro_rest_api_route_capabilities filter and/or pmpro_rest_api_permissions filter to change this behavior.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issues with the PMPro REST API endpoints, including the discount code and checkout level endpoints.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue with backslashes in the display name when editing form the PMPro frontend profile page.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where timestamps were showing up incorrectly for recent orders shown on the dashboard page.
BUG FIX: Fixed issue where PMPro would always try to add capabilities to the administrator role, even if you removed that role for some reason.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_get_no_access_message() function, which can be used to show the no access messages.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a "show_noaccess" property to the membership shortcode. When set, it will show the noaccess message to users who don't have the levels specified.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_user_profile_update_errors hook, which can be used to show errors on the PMPro frontend profile page.
* ENHANCEMENT: The pmpro_set_capabilities_for_role() function now returns true or false if the caps were added in case others want to use this function and tell if it worked.
* ENHANCEMENT: You can now include links in the description of the fields you add to the PMPro advanced settings page via the pmpro_custom_advanced_settings filter.
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated the PayPal gateways to use the latest versions of the PayPal buttons.
* ENHANCEMENT: Fixed styling of the PMPro update script notice.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added the pmpro_account_membership_expiration_text filter to the expiration dates shown on the cancel page when using MMPU.

= 2.4.1 - 2020-08-10 =
* BUG FIX: Fixed issues with password resets on WP Engine hosting due to security features added by their mu-plugin.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where end dates were showing up incorrectly in the confirmation email sometimes.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where renewing memberships were extended one day less than they should have been in some cases.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where users without a PMPro Plus license were sometimes not getting an error when trying to update a Plus Add On.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Added compatibility for core auto-updates for our Add Ons which aren't hosted in the .org repository.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed issue where PHP sessions were set up to track ReCAPTCHA even if you weren't using ReCAPTCHA. ReCAPTCHA is now only loaded on the checkout page. Loading sessions unecessarily would break some Varnish cache setups.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Updated the single invoice/order page. No longer showing the end date, which isn't really related to the order. Showing a better status related to the order now.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed some links to the PMPro site in the plugin admin area.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now saving a hash of the Stripe secretkey when saving webhook ids. This allows us to keep track of webhook ids if you switch between gateway environments or swap your Stripe keys for some reason.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: No longer running the Terms of Service text through wpautop. This usually just added extra spacing to your TOS. Shortcodes are rendered now though. Added a filter pmpro_tos_content so you can change the TOS content or how it is shown.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a checkout_levels API endpoint. This will allow us to build features that adjust the price on the frontend at checkout.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_member_profile_edit_form_tag action to the form tag on the frontend member profile page. This is useful to set the form enctype for file uploads.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added Romanian Leu as a currency option.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added the pmpro_stripe_payment_intent_params filter. Useful if you would like to set a specific statement descriptor for the site. See https://gist.github.com/ideadude/16983fdfa0da12fc40ef36d870f4cbd0
* REFACTOR: Removed some unused methods from the Stripe class.
* REFACTOR: Removed the help pointer about the menu location change.

= 2.4 - 2020-07-24 =
* FEATURE: Now detecting if the Stripe webhook is set up correctly. You can now create or disable the webhook from the payment settings page in the WP admin dashboard.
* FEATURE: Added a link to use and set up SendWP for more reliable email sending from WP.
* BUG FIX: Fixed further issues with dates and timezones.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where reports would cause white screens on some server set ups. We had some report start dates set to 1960, which caused issues. (Thanks, Sam "gausam" on GitHub)
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue with the query to find expiring memberships that happened on certain MySQL setups.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue that was caused if other code called wp_login_url() too early.
* BUG FIX: Fixed an error in the is_login_page() function.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a fatal error that was happening in PHP 5.2 or earlier due to code syntax that was not supported then. We noticed a few other cases as well, but decided we won't support PHP 5.2 consistent with WP and other plugins.
* BUG FIX: Fixed the URL used when using 2Checkout in sandbox mode.
* BUG FIX: Fixed JavaScript errors that would occur sometimes on the Billing Update page when using the Stripe gateway.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where the dummy $0 orders created when using the "Stripe Updates" feature weren't saving with the updated subscription_transaction_id. This would prevent future payments from being linked to that user and could prevent subscriptions cancellations from being synchronized. When updating to PMPro 2.4, an update script will run to try to restore these subscription_transaction_id values. However, any recurring orders that occured when the id was missing will not be added to PMPro. You will have to update them manually.
* BUG FIX: Fixed JavaScript error on the edit discount code page.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Showing expiration date as text when it is set as a readonly field. (Thanks, Rodmar "rodmarzavala" on GitHub)
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now checking if headers were already sent before trying to start the PHP session. If headers are sent before PMPro tries to start the session, there is usually another error somewhere on the WP site that needs to be fixed. But at least we aren't adding to the confusion by trying to start the session late causing another error in the log.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Updated misleading hint for the PayPal Express IPN URL on the payment settings page.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed invalid key description in the SQL in includes/setup.sql. The actually query used to set up table in PMPro was correct though. The setup.sql file is included for reference and developers who want to create the tables "manually" in MySQL.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: The post type search filter now supports cases where post type set in WPQuery is an array.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed warning that showed when a user with no levels visited the frontend account page.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Fixing warnings that would be logged at checkout in certain cases.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Better handling of cases where users who checked out using a gateway different from the current setting are shown a message that they cannot update their billing information. They should instead checkout again to renew their membership.
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated to use the latest version of the Stripe API and SDK.
* ENHANCEMENT: More detailed logging for Braintree webhook debug emails.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a getTransactionStatus method to the PayPal and PayPal Express payment gateway classes. (Thanks, Mirco Babini)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a checkout_level API call. This will be used in the future to update the price total at checking using JS and is also needed to implement support for Google Pay and Apple Pay through Stripe.
* ENHANCEMENT: Cleaned up the email settings page.
* ENHANCEMENT: Better handling of some login and password reset errors.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added links to the PMPro YouTube and Facebook profiles.
* REFACTOR: Cleaned up some code in incldues/content.php, especially around the pmpro_search_filter() function.
* REFACTOR: Removed the package-lock.json file from the repository.

= 2.3.4 - 2020-06-18 =
* SECURITY: Better escaping of values on the billing and confirmation pages.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where expiration dates could be set to 1 day in the past when editing a user in the dashboard if certain timezones were chosen in the General settings.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where users were redirected back to the /login/ page if WordPress needed them to confirm their admin email address. Users will now be taken to the default WP login page with the form to confirm their email address.
* BUG FIX: Fixed bug where the reset password link in the new user email was not filtered to go to the frontend login page if being used.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where some errors were not being shown when password resets failed.
* BUG FIX: Fixed bug with action links added to the orders table.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where empty dates would show current date in the members list.
* BUG FIX: Fixed fatal error that was happening when using some of the new API endpoints.
* BUG FIX: Timestamps returned by the Stripe API when getting the next payment date needed to be adjusted based on the site's timezone setting.
* BUG FIX: Fixed a bug where the change password form wouldn't show up sometimes when using the login shortcode.
* BUG FIX: Fixed notice in the PayPal IPN handler when adding notes to an order.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where PMPro would generate the wrong excerpt in some cases where the more tag was used but the excerpt was generated before the more tag code or blog was not yet converted to HTML. Specifically this fixes an issue with excerpts generated for AMP with the SchemaApp plugin.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Added an advanced setting to "Uninstall PMPro on Deletion". You must check and save this option first or PMPro will not delete data from the DB when deleting from the plugins page. This keeps users from accidentally deleting orders and member data.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now hiding the profile and change password links on the membership account page if a frontend profile page is not set and users are locked from the WP dashboard by the advanced setting.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Resetting the signups and cancellations report cache when there are new membership level changes.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_get_element_class function and filter. We now use this function when adding classes to HTML elements in our templates. The filter can be used to alter or append to the classes used in the HTML tags. This will make it easier to create code and CSS to make PMPro look better with popular themes.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_authorizenet_post_values filter to the Authorize.net class. An array of $post_values is passed in to be filtered along with a string for the API method about to be called.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_member_profile_edit_user_object_fields filter to add or remove fields from the frontend edit profile page.
* ENHANCEMENT: Now showing information about the current billing method on the update billing page. Can hide this information by having the pmpro_billing_show_payment_method filter return false.
* ENHANCEMENT: No longer saying "Great Work!" in the admin digest emails. This was especially embarrassing if you didn't have any sales during the diget period.
* REFACTOR: Refactored some code in the CSV exports to avoid false positives by malware scanners.
* REFACTOR: Added a build_post_string method to the Authorize.net class to avoid redundant code.
* REFACTOR: Added a cancelSubscriptionAtGateway method to the PayPal Express class. This is useful if you want to cancel the subscription without cancelling the membership. (Thanks, Mirco Babini)

= 2.3.3 - 2020-05-13 =
* SECURITY: Fixed SQL injection vulnerability when logged in as an administrator and adding new orders in the dashboard. JVN#20248858 (Thanks, Kenichi Okuno of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc)
* SECURITY: Making sure to properly escape all values on the add/edit order form in the dashboard.
* BUG FIX: Now properly setting the order status to "error" when an initial payment fails when using PayPal Express. Before the order status would be set as "cancelled", which would count the order toward reports and make it harder to find orders that had errors. (Thanks, Mirco Babini)
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue with the PMPro logo and some other assets loading over the wrong schema (http vs https) in some cases.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where the chosen discount code was not shown after submitting when adding a new order through the dashboard.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Using "PMPro" in the admin activity email subject to keep the line shorter and avoid issues when replacing the word "member" via gettext.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a pmpro_allow_weak_passwords filter. You can set this to return true (like this https://gist.github.com/ideadude/5a12119b9ce1c2aad87b2d69cb8f9505) to allow weak passwords on the change password and reset password pages. Note that at this time, weak passwords are still allowed on the checkout page no matter the value of this filter. We expect to change that in the future. For now, you can use our PMPro Strong Passwords plugin to force strong passwords at checkout.
* REFACTOR: Updated the logic around checking the PMPRO_IPN_DEBUG constant in the IPN handler. (Thanks, Mirco Babini)

= 2.3.2 - 2020-05-07 =
* BUG FIX: Fixed errors calling is_main_query() that came up with certain themes.
* BUG FIX: Fixed typo in the pmpro_account_profile_action_links filter.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Added a new force parameter to the pmpro_getAllLevels() function. This is used by the Multisite Membership Add On to fix an issue where levels were missing or incorrect on the subsites.
* ENHANCEMENT: Removed mention of the ezAdsense plugin, which has been discontinued.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added $recipient param in sendAdminActivity() function so you can send additional activity emails like this https://gist.github.com/dparker1005/6bf650370a12aef44adf8c8c26d3e906

= 2.3.1 - 2020-05-01 =
* BUG FIX: Fixed infinite redirect issue if no account page was set. Fixed a few other places where we do is_page() type checks just in case.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where all pages were retitled to Welcome when logged in, if no login page was set.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue with BuddyBoss and other themes/plugins that use the_title filter with only one parameter.
* BUG FIX: Fixed error when trying to check if is_main_query in the admin or with certain themes.

= 2.3 - 2020-05-01 =
* FEATURE: Added frontend login and password reset.

* FEATURE: Added Beaver Builder module compatibility to restrict modules by membership level.
* FEATURE: Created new REST API endpoints and extended existing endpoints.
* FEATURE: Updated Elementor code to allow for restriction of "sections" as well.
* BUG FIX: Updated all timestamp code to be compatible with WordPress v5.4+ which fixes issues where orders could lose one hour or one day when saved.
* BUG FIX: Updated logic to filter body_class on pages with Membership Account shortcode or any "section" of the shortcode displayed.
* BUG FIX: Improved `pmpro_getAllLevels` function to cache even when `force` is `true`. This saves multiple DB hits per page load.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Cancellation report now calculates based on membership enddate.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Fixed warnings and errors in PHP 7.4+.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now allowing translation for text generated by JavaScript.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Updated all uses of "Email" to remove the hyphen.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Updated to default to international addresses on Billing Information page. Fixes a bug with the State Dropdown Add-On.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now treating "recurring_payment_failed" transactions from PayPal IPN as cancellations. PMPro will cancel membership and attempt to cancel the associated subscription.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added membership level class for the `PMPro_Membership_Level` object. This is currently only used in the REST API calls, but will eventually be used whenever interacting with a membership level object or array.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added discount code class for the `PMPro_Discount_Code` object. This is currently only used in the REST API calls, but will eventually be used whnever interacting with a discount code object or array.
* ENHANCEMENT: Now allowing all users and members access to the Membership Account page.
* ENHANCEMENT: Updating logic for all redirects from core pages like Invoices, Billing, and Cancel to allow past members to access their data. Generally more often redirecting where you would expect to in different situations.

* ENHANCEMENT: Added `getSubscriptionStatus` method to the Stripe gateway API class. This fixes issues with the PMPro Subscription Check Add-On.

= 2.1.2 - 2019-09-26 =
* BUG FIX: Fixed bug where Stripe subscriptions weren't updated to use the new payment method when users updated their billing method on the Update Billing page. You may have users with an updated "default payment method" but their subscriptions still need to be updated manually in Stripe to use that new method. Otherwise, payments will fail.

* ENHANCEMENT: Using the site's date format option when printing orders.

* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Updated Russian Ruble definition to have 0 decimals and use &nbsp; as the thousands separator. (Thanks, Airat Halitov)
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Using add_query_arg when generating IPN URLs to avoid issues on sites that aren't using pretty permalinks or have moved their admin directory.

* BUG FIX: Fixed several error handling issues with the Cybersource gateway integration.
* REFACTOR: Moved JavaScript out of pages/checkout.php and other places into files in the /js/ folder. This will avoid issues where other JS at checkout breaks PMPro checkout and will improve compatibility with tools that optimize JS.

* REFACTOR: The JS function askfirst is now prefixed as pmpro_askfirst.

* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now sending display_name to the $data array passed to PMPro email filters. (Thanks, David Cervantes Caballero)
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now searching for the last order with "success" or "pending" status on the Billing page.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_checkout_preheader_before_get_level_at_checkout and pmpro_checkout_preheader_after_get_level_at_checkout action hooks. Using pmpro_checkout_preheader_before_get_level_at_checkout to start the session earlier now.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Removed the "membership_code_id" and "membership_code" as field options for the member shortcode. These weren't working and it's unclear what would be meant to ask for a user's discount code since a user could have several orders with or without discount codes. Added "membership_description" and "membership_confirmation" instead.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Filtering the password reset message to make sure the link still works in all cases when we convert emails to HTML.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Added reCAPTCHA v3 and invisible reCAPTCHA support. It is recommended sites using Stripe or Braintree update to the reCAPTCHA v3 option. Read more here: https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/pmpro-update-2-0-5/
* REFACTOR: Now running the pmpro_billing_preheader hook after the jquery.creditCardValidator script is enqueued in preheader/billing.php to match how we do it in preheader/checkout.php. (Thanks, Rafe Colton)

= 2.0.4 - 2019-01-14 =

* BUG FIX: Setting priority of pmpro_check_admin_capabilities to 5 to ensure it runs before dashboard redirect.
* BUG FIX: Removed duplicate id attribute on the Membership Account page "cancel" action link.
* BUG FIX/PERFORMANCE: No longer enqueueing frontend.blocks.js which had no functional code, but loaded a lot of Gutenberg JS that wasn't needed on the frontend. When/if our blogs have frontend JS, we will load it again, but also make sure the dependencies are correct.
* BUG FIX/PERFORMANCE: No longer loading blocks.style.css. These frontend styles were redundant with CSS in css/frontend.css.
* NOTE: The SVN repository was missing the 2.0.3 tag when that update went out. Some users may have updated or tried to update and not gotten the correct files for 2.0.3. Everyone should update to 2.0.4, which is Gucci.

= 2.0.3 - 2019-01-11 =
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where code in the Stripe gateway was cancelling old subscriptions early if users renewed with a different gateway. NOTE: There was a fix for this in version 2.0, but it wasn't implemented fully.
* BUG FIX: Filtering pmpro_other_order_ids_to_cancel to make sure the current checkout's order doesn't get cancelled. This started happening in version 2.0 since we started setting the user_id on orders for existing users before the checkout was fully processed. This fix along with the one above and others will fix cases where users were being cancelled immediately after checkout.
* BUG FIX: Fixed warning on edit levels page by defaulting $confirmation_in_email to 0.

= 2.0.2 - 2019-01-10 =
* BUG FIX: Fixed issues when using non-US currencies. Using the pmpro_round_price function in a few places it was needed. Prepared for a later update that will increase the number of decimals on certain columns in the DB to 8 to support currencies like Bitcoin, but shelving the actual DB update for version 2.1.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where existing users who checked out could run into problems. Added a getMembershipLevelAtCheckout method to the MemberOrder class and using that during checkout. The getMembershipLevel method would see the user_id property of the order (added to orders at checkout in version 2.0) and lookup the level data from the pmpro_memberships_users table instead of using the pmpro_level global. Then gateways like PayPal Express (but others also) would use the wrong data when making calls to pmpro_isLevelRecurring/etc.
* BUG FIX: Fixed bug where a notice to deactivate the Better Logins Report plugin could show up for users who couldn't deactive the plugin.
* BUG FIX: Fixed bad translation in the membership_expired.html file of the French translation.

* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Updating Stripe Webhook and PayPal IPN Handler to send the cancelled level ID for better cancellation emails.

= 1.9.5.4 - 2018-09-10 =
* SECURITY: Some values used in SQL queries in our reporting code were sanitized but not later escaped via esc_sql(). All variables added to SQL queries in the reports are now wrapped in esc_sql(). The previous code was not vulnerable to any known attack, but this change hardens the code against vulnerabilities in the case other parts of the code change in the future.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue with lost passwords when Theme My Login 7 is active. (Thanks, Jeff Farthing)
* BUG FIX: No longer sending an "error canceling the subscription" email when subscriptions are cancelled from Stripe.
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where TwoCheckout orders were not correctly updating the TOS consent data. (Thanks, Charl P. Botha)
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where privacy function weren't defaulting to $current_user correctly. In practice, we were always passing a user_id anyway.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Changed the confirmation message to use wpautop instead of apply_filters('the_content'). If you were relying on shortcodes or other content that required that filter, you use add_filter('pmpro_level_description', 'the_content') to revert this for your site.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Using the strict parameter of sanitize_user when getting usernames. This will prevent some special characters from being used in usernames at checkout. This is inline with WP core and other plugins. (Thanks, David Cervantes Caballero)
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a breakdown of orders at each price point to the Sales Report widget
* ENHANCEMENT: Showing the Stripe version we use on the Payment Settings page.
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated Copyright date and GPLv2 link in license.txt.

* BUG FIX: Fixed PayPal IPN Handler to set the status of old levels to 'changed' (instead of 'inactive') when processing checkouts. This will improve the accuracy of reports.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now checking for the recurring_payment_skipped transaction type in the PayPal IPN handler. When a payment is skipped and this message is sent, we will now fire off the failed payment email to the customer and admin. (Thanks, mjulian87 on GitHub)
* ENHANCEMENT: Removed validation info from the IPN log.
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated German (de_DE) language files.

= 1.9.5 - 2018-05-24 =

* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Using the pmpro_getOrderStatuses() function in adminpages/orders.php instead of redundant code there.
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Passing the $order as a second parameter to pmpro_after_checkout when called from the PayPal IPN handler. (The $order was being passed already for "regular" checkouts.)

* FEATURE: Added support for the privacy features added in WP 4.9.6. Details below.
* FEATURE: Added suggest privacy page text.

The ereaser deletes a number of user meta fields (filterable through the new pmpro_get_personal_user_meta_fields_to_erase filter). A user's membership history and order history are retained unless the user is deleted.
* FEATURE: Now saving a log of when the TOS page is agreed to at checkout. The ID and date modified of the TOS post is saved along with a timestamp of when the TOS was agreed to. This information is shown on the single order page in the admin, the orders CSV export, and on the edit user profile page in the admin. Note that this feature does not yet backport any data for existing users or ask users to re-agree to the TOS if the TOS has gone out of date.

= 1.9.4.4 - 2018-03-14 =
* BUG FIX: Updated the filters to extend membership levels to use the new pmpro_getSpecificMembershipLevelForUser() function to avoid bugs when MMPU is enabled.

* BUG: Fixed issue where PayPal Standard IPN requests were being rejected if a tax amount was set in PayPal.
* BUG: Fixed issue with Stripe subscription "updates" that were set to fire on "next payment", e.g. if you used Stripe with levels with a non-zero trial amount. When the update processed and created a new subscription, the old subscription was not being deleted and the new subscription ID was not being saved as a new order for future tracking purposes. If you use this feature, please check in Stripe to make sure your users don't have extra subscriptions.
* BUG: Fixed setting in PayPal/PayPal Express API calls from AUTOBILLAMT to AUTOBILLOUTAMT. This setting is set to AddToNextBilling, meaning that failed payment amounts are added to the next billing cycle's amount if left unpaid. In most cases, a retry of the original billed amount goes through or the user's subscription is cancelled. But just in case, this makes sure that outstanding balances are paid. (Thanks, jubstuff on GitHub)
* BUG: Fixed warnings in the setGateway method of the MemberOrder class for cases where the gateway is missing or the class file is not found.

= 1.8.11.2 =
* BUG: Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.11 that kept PMPro from tracking coupon code uses. Any checkout with a discount code while running 1.8.11 won't have properly tracked the discount code use. You may want to adjust your "uses" numbers for your codes, and hand check any reporting/etc that relied on discount codes. Users of the Sponsored Members addon will have been affected too. Discount codes will need to be made manually for any sponsor who checked out.
* BUG: Fix to the expiration warnings code. Making sure it finds all members who are expiring soon while also keeping track of when emails are sent so users don't get too many emails.
* BUG: Fixed issue where pmpro_before_change_membership_level was running after levels had been changed.
* BUG: Fixed some warnings.

* BUG: Fixed warnings in the PayPal IPN handler.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_checkout_level filter and now using that filter to apply the_content filters to the level description at checkout. This allows you to turn off the the_content filters (e.g. processing shortcodes) by using remove_filter('pmpro_checkout_level', 'pmpro_pmpro_checkout_level'); in a custom plugin.
* BUG/ENHANCEMENT: Using the pmpro_confirmation_message filter on the confirmation page whether there is an invoice or not. Now also adding the the_content filters to the confirmation message. You can disable this by using remove_filter('pmpro_confirmation_message', 'pmpro_pmpro_confirmation_message'); in a custom plugin.

* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_subscription_ipn_event_processed hook to IPN handler.

* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_getLevelsCost() - with an s - function to get the combined cost of multiple levels in an array.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_getLevelsExpiration() - with an s - function to get the combined expiration text for multiple levels in array.
* ENHANCEMENT: Created the pmpro_getLevelAtCheckout function that modularizes some of the logic of creating the pmpro_level global at checkout.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_members_list_user filter used on the admin members list and members list CSV export.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a 4th parameter $cancel_level to pmpro_changeMembershipLevel(). If set, that level will definitely be cancelled locally and at the gateway. This parameter is also passed to the pmpro_before_change_membership_level and pmpro_after_change_membership_level hook.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a new function pmpro_cancelMembershipLevel($level_id, $user_id, $old_level_status) that acts as a wrapper to pass the $cancel_level param to pmpro_changeMembershipLevel().
* ENHANCEMENT: Updated the cancel page on the frontend to support the Multiple Memberships per User addon. All memberships are shown. You can cancel individual memberships separately. The language of the confirm button mentions memberships vs account.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added pmpro_getMemberOrdersByCheckoutID($checkout_id) function to support Multiple Memberships per User and others using the checkout_id.
* ENHANCEMENT: Added a refund($order, $transaction_id) method to the PMPro_stripe class. This will be used by the Multiple Memberships per User addon and eventually used in other areas by the core pluginn.
