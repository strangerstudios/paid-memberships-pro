Typically, this is not an issue, but sometimes a combination of custom code or add ons for PMPro (e.g. the Prorating or Auto-renewal Checkbox add ons) will try to set a Profile Start Date out past 1 year in order to respect an existing user's original expiration date before they checked out. The user's information is below. PMPro has allowed the checkout and simply restricted the Profile Start Date to 1 year out with a possible additional free Trial of up to 1 year. You should double check this information to determine if maybe the user has overpaid or otherwise needs to be addressed. If you get many of these emails, you should consider adjusting your custom code to avoid these situations."
msgstr "Ödeme sırasında bir kullanıcının aboneliği için 'Profil Başlangıç Tarihi' ayarlanırken olası bir sorun vardı. PayPal, 1 yıldan daha ileri bir Profil Başlangıç Tarihi ayarlanmasına izin vermiyor. Tipik olarak bu bir sorun değildir, ancak bazen PMPro için özel kod veya eklentilerin bir kombinasyonu (örneğin, Prorating veya Auto-renewal Checkbox eklentileri), mevcut bir kullanıcının ödeme yapmadan önceki orijinal son kullanma tarihine saygı duymak için 1 yıldan sonra bir Profil Başlangıç Tarihi ayarlamaya çalışacaktır. Kullanıcının bilgileri aşağıdadır. PMPro ödeme yapılmasına izin verdi ve Profil Başlangıç Tarihini 1 yıla kadar olası bir ek ücretsiz Deneme ile 1 yıl ile sınırlandırdı. Kullanıcının fazla ödeme yapıp yapmadığını veya başka bir şekilde ele alınması gerekip gerekmediğini belirlemek için bu bilgileri iki kez kontrol etmelisiniz. Bu e-postalardan çok sayıda alıyorsanız, bu durumlardan kaçınmak için özel kodunuzu ayarlamayı düşünmelisiniz."
