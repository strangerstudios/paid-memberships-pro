Typically, this is not an issue, but sometimes a combination of custom code or add ons for PMPro (e.g. the Prorating or Auto-renewal Checkbox add ons) will try to set a Profile Start Date out past 1 year in order to respect an existing user's original expiration date before they checked out. The user's information is below. PMPro has allowed the checkout and simply restricted the Profile Start Date to 1 year out with a possible additional free Trial of up to 1 year. You should double check this information to determine if maybe the user has overpaid or otherwise needs to be addressed. If you get many of these emails, you should consider adjusting your custom code to avoid these situations."
