Typically, this is not an issue, but sometimes a combination of custom code or add ons for PMPro (e.g. the Prorating or Auto-renewal Checkbox add ons) will try to set a Profile Start Date out past 1 year in order to respect an existing user's original expiration date before they checked out. The user's information is below. PMPro has allowed the checkout and simply restricted the Profile Start Date to 1 year out with a possible additional free Trial of up to 1 year. You should double check this information to determine if maybe the user has overpaid or otherwise needs to be addressed. If you get many of these emails, you should consider adjusting your custom code to avoid these situations."
msgstr "Hi ha hagut un problema potencial en establir la «Data d'inici del perfil» a la subscripció d'un usuari en finalitzar la compra. PayPal no permet establir una data d'inici del perfil de més d'1 any. Normalment, això no sol ser un problema, però de vegades la combinació de codi personalitzat o de complements de PMPro (p.ex. els complements Prorating o Auto-renewal Checkbox) intentaran establir una data d'inici del perfil de més d'1 any per tal de respectar la data de caducitat original d'un usuari existent abans de finalitzar la compra. La informació de l'usuari es troba a sota. PMPro ha permès el pagament i simplement ha restringit la data d'inici del perfil a 1 any, amb un període de prova addicional possible de fins a 1 any. Hauríeu de revisar aquesta informació per determinar si és possible que l'usuari hagi pagat de més o si necessita algun tipus de solució. Si rebeu molts correus d'aquests hauríeu de plantejar-vos modificar el vostre codi personalitzat per evitar aquestes situacions."
