The user's information is below. PMPro has allowed the checkout and simply restricted the Profile Start Date to 1 year out with a possible additional free Trial of up to 1 year. You should double check this information to determine if maybe the user has overpaid or otherwise needs to be addressed. If you get many of these emails, you should consider adjusting your custom code to avoid these situations."

PayPal non consente di impostare una data di inizio del profilo superiore a 1 anno. In genere questo non è un problema, ma a volte una combinazione di codice personalizzato o di add-on per PMPro (ad esempio gli add-on Prorating o Auto-renewal Checkbox) cerca di impostare una data di inizio del profilo oltre 1 anno per rispettare la data di scadenza originale di un utente esistente prima del pagamento. Le informazioni dell'utente sono riportate di seguito. PMPro ha consentito il pagamento e ha semplicemente limitato la data di inizio del profilo a un anno, con la possibilità di una prova gratuita aggiuntiva fino a un anno. Dovresti ricontrollare queste informazioni per determinare se l'utente ha pagato troppo o se è necessario intervenire in altro modo. Se ricevi molte di queste email, dovresti prendere in considerazione la possibilità di modificare il tuo codice personalizzato per evitare queste situazioni."
